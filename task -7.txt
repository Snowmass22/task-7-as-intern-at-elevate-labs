Analysis of Harm from Malicious Extensions:

Malicious extensions pose a significant threat because they run with the same privileges as the user, potentially accessing all sensitive browsing data. The research indicates that the main ways malicious extensions harm users are:

Credential Harvesting: They can act as keyloggers or form sniffers to steal login details and financial information.

Search and Homepage Redirection: They can redirect the user to ad-supported or phishing sites, generating revenue for the attacker.

Eavesdropping: They can inject code into web pages to track and log every website the user visits, compromising privacy.
